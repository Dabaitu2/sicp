## Considering a scenario where number-based identification can not solve deadlock issue

if the serializer composed procdure was separated
we can't force the inner logic was controlled by comparing the number they have then!

for example
account1 wants to get some money from account2, while account2 wants to get some money from account1
and they just happened in different places without negotiation

under that scenario

```scheme
(define (transfer account-to account-from amount)
    ((account-to 'withdraw) amount)
    ((account-from 'deposit) amount)
)


;; in real worlds, the transfer procdures can't be negotiated in advance
;; that means we have no chance to get account's number and put them into correct serializer
(parallel-execute (lambda () (transfer a1 a2 20))
                  (lambda () (transfer a2 a1 20)))
```

总而言之，能够事先获取 serializer 并且合理规划顺序的前提就是所有需要获取的资源一开始已经协商过了
如果没有协商，死锁是无法避免的。因为我们根本不知道应该按照怎样的顺序去把他们放到对应的 serializer 里
