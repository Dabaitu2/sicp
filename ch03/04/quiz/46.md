## Prove of potential issue while two processors simultaneously access the same mutex

```scheme
(define (make-mutex)
  (let ((cell (list false)))
    (define (the-mutex m)
      (cond ((eq? m 'accquire)
             ;; if cell is true, which means some other procedure has acquired the lock, need to do it
             ;; recursively
             (if (test-and-set! cell)
                 (the-mutex 'accquire))) ;retry
            ((eq? m 'release) (clear! cell))))
    the-mutex))

(define (clear! cell)
  (set-car! cell false))

(define (test-and-set! cell)
  (if (car cell)
      true
      (begin (set-car! cell true)
             false)))
```

suppose there are two processors that attained to test-and-set

P1 -> car cell -> false -> P2 car cell : false -> p1 set-car true -> p2 set-car true -> executed with interleaving!
