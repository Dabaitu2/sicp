## prove of potential problems if initial exchange procdure was used
```
a1 10
a2 20
a3 30

a1<->a2
a2<->a3


a1 <-> a2 a1 get 10, a2 get 20, a1 + 10, a2 - 10
a2 <-> a3 a2 get 20, a3 get 30, a2 + 10, a3 - 10 

1. a1 get 10, a2 get 20, diff => 10
3. a1 <-> a2 => a2 - 10, a1 + 10 => a1 20, a2 20, a3 20 
2. a2 <-> a3, a2 => 30, a3 => 20

now: the condition 1 has changed: a1, a2, a3 are not longer the combination of 10,20,30
but the total value would not change

prove: 
no matter what kind of sequnce of those procedure 
the deposit and withdraw are always balanced (they are the same! some of the account lost x, while others will append x) 
so the total would not change
```


## prove of potential problem is sequence of account behavior was not serialized

a1 10
a2 20

a1<->a2
a2<->a3


a1 <-> a2 a1 get 10, a2 get 20, a1 + 10, a2 - 10
a2 <-> a3 a2 get 20, a3 get 30, a2 + 10, a3 - 10 

1. a1 <-> a2 | a1 get 10, a2 get 20, diff => 10
2. a1 <-> a2 | a1 deposit => a1 = 20
3. a1 <-> a2 | in a2 withdraw, get a2 20, will set a2 = 10
4. a2 <-> a3 | a2 get 20, a3 get 30, a2 deposit, 
5. a2 <-> a3 | in a2 deposit, get a2 20, will set a2 = 30
6. a1 <-> a2 | in a2 withdraw, set a2 = 10
6. a2 <-> a3 | in a3 deposit, set a2 = 30
7. a2 <-> a3 | a3 withdraw, a3 = 20 
now the total is 20+20+30 = 70 != 10+20+30, the original condition was broken!
