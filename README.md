# Learning Sicp

![sicp](./images/sicp.png)

## Aim

This repo is the record of learning the concept, besides, cause most of the knowledge of this book is hidden underneath the quiz.
I manage to 

- finish _ALL codeable practice_ and provide _executable anwser_ of them (e.g Painter, Computation of Polynomial, Tower of types..)
- fuse them into the codes provided by main text, so you can check them just in each section directories rather than quiz (which are just snippets and can not br run).
- avoid induce any thrid-lib or internal methods provided by sicp / racket to make all the results are generated by my *'handwrite'* codes

It might be the difference with other similar project (just from those I referred before)

## Organization of this project 
I build a directory for each subsection of each section of seach Chapter. It includes all the codes, including codes to answer quiz. 
But for quiz, I put all the quiz belongs to one `sections` together rather than seperating into different subsection directories just for simplicity.



## Progress

I've finished the quiz up to <del>2.91</del> 3.23.
