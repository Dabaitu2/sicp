;; Define rules to implement the reverse operation of Exercise 2.18, which returns a list containing the same elements as a given list in reverse order.
;; (Hint: Use append-to-form.)
;; Can your rules answer both (reverse (1 2 3) ?x) and (reverse ?x (1 2 3))?


(rule (append-to-form () ?y ?y))
(rule (append-to-form (?u . ?v) ?y (?u . ?z))
      (append-to-form ?v ?y ?z))

(rule (reverse () ()))
;; charming recursion ;)
(rule (reverse (?x . ?y) ?r)
      (and (reverse ?y ?ry)
           (append-to-form ?ry (?x) ?r)))
